# Small Time Series Analysis
 Don't judge my love for time series analysis, okay. I have a bias toward them because I love using plotly, so this is what this is. I intend to do more, in-depth visualization as well.
 
 The entirety of this project can be opened in Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab, and will end in a customized analysis. 
 
 I am also considering doing another attempt at an ARIMA model with this analysis, because the last one I did didn't pan out. I would probably try to do it in R, though. 
 
 Otherwise this will just end with visualizations.
